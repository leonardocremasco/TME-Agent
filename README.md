Welcome to the TME-Agent repository! TME stands for "Task Memory Engine," a structured memory engine designed for large language model (LLM) agents. This project enables agents to plan, rollback, and reason across multi-step tasks. We are currently upgrading to a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure to enhance performance and capabilities.

## Introduction

The TME-Agent serves as a foundational tool for building intelligent agents that can handle complex tasks. By leveraging structured memory, agents can maintain context and state across interactions, making them more effective in multi-agent environments. The ongoing DAG upgrade aims to improve task planning and reasoning capabilities.

## Features

- **Structured Memory**: Retain context and state across tasks.
- **Multi-step Task Handling**: Efficiently manage complex workflows.
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert to previous states when needed.
- **Reasoning Engine**: Make informed decisions based on stored information.
- **DAG Upgrade**: Enhance performance and scalability.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Seamlessly connect with OpenAI models like ChatGPT.
